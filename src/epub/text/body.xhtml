<A>William, sir.</A><br>

<A>A fair name. Wast born i’ the forest here?</A><br>

<A>Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Touchstone</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,</A><br>
<A>‘The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man</A><br>
<A>knows himself to be a fool.’ The heathen</A><br>
<A>philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,</A><br>
<A>would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;</A><br>
<A>meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and</A><br>
<A>lips to open. You do love this maid?</A><br>

<A>No, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Touchstone</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it</A><br>
<A>is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out</A><br>
<A>of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty</A><br>
<A>the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse</A><br>
<A>is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.</A><br>

<A>society⁠—which in the boorish is company⁠—of this</A><br>
<A>female⁠—which in the common is woman; which</A><br>
<A>together is, abandon the society of this female, or,</A><br>
<A>clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better</A><br>
<A>understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make</A><br>
<A>thee away, translate thy life into death, thy</A><br>
<A>liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with</A><br>
<A>thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy</A><br>
<A>with thee in faction; I will o’errun thee with</A><br>
<A>policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:</A><br>
<A>therefore tremble and depart.</A><br>

<A>I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;</A><br>
<A>consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it</A><br>
<A>shall be to your good; for my father’s house and all</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A>It is my arm.</A><br>

<A>Ay, and greater wonders than that.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>

<A>O, I know where you are: nay, ’tis true: there was</A><br>
<A>never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams</A><br>
<A>and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of ‘I came, saw, and</A><br>
<A>overcame:’ for your brother and my sister no sooner</A><br>
<A>met but they looked, no sooner looked but they</A><br>
<A>loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner</A><br>
<A>sighed but they asked one another the reason, no</A><br>
<A>sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;</A><br>
<A>and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs</A><br>
<A>to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or</A><br>
<A>else be incontinent before marriage: they are in</A><br>
<A>the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs</A><br>
<A>cannot part them.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>

<A>They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the</A><br>
<A>duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it</A><br>
<A>is to look into happiness through another man’s</A><br>
<A>eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at</A><br>
<A>the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall</A><br>
<A>think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.</A><br>

<A>Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?</A><br>

<A>I can live no longer by thinking.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.</A><br>
<A>Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,</A><br>
<A>that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I</A><br>
<A>speak not this that you should bear a good opinion</A><br>
<A>of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;</A><br>
<A>neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in</A><br>
<A>some little measure draw a belief from you, to do</A><br>
<A>yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if</A><br>
<A>you please, that I can do strange things: I have,</A><br>
<A>since I was three year old, conversed with a</A><br>
<A>magician, most profound in his art and yet not</A><br>
<A>damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart</A><br>
<A>as your gesture cries it out, when your brother</A><br>
<A>marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into</A><br>
<A>what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is</A><br>
<A>not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient</A><br>
<A>to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human</A><br>
<A>as she is and without any danger.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A>Speakest thou in sober meanings?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I</A><br>
<A>say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your</A><br>
<A>best array: bid your friends; for if you will be</A><br>
<A>married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.</A><br>
