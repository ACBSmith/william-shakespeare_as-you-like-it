<br/>
<span>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love:</span>
<br/>
<span>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</span>
<br/>
<span>Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</span>

<A>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</A><br>
<A>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</A><br>
<A>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</A><br>
<A>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</A><br>
<A>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</A><br>
<A>of an If, as, ‘If you said so, then I said so;’ and</A><br>
<A>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</A><br>
<A>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</A><br>

<A>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</A><br>
<A>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</A><br>
<A>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</A><br>
<A>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</A><br>
<A>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</A><br>
<A>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I’ll begin</A><br>
<A>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</A><br>
<A>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</A><br>
<A>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</A><br>
<A>you bear to women⁠—as I perceive by your simpering,</A><br>
<A>none of you hates them⁠—that between you and the</A><br>
<A>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</A><br>
<A>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</A><br>
<A>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</A><br>
<A>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</A><br>
<A>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</A><br>
<A>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</A><br>
