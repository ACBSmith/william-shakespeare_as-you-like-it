<H3>ACT IV</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. The forest.</h3>
<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES</i>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Jaques</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted</A><br>
<A>with thee.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>They say you are a melancholy fellow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Jaques</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Those that are in extremity of either are abominable</A><br>
<A>fellows and betray themselves to every modern</A><br>
<A>censure worse than drunkards.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Jaques</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Why then, ’tis good to be a post.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Jaques</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is</A><br>
<A>emulation, nor the musician’s, which is fantastical,</A><br>
<A>nor the courtier’s, which is proud, nor the</A><br>
<A>soldier’s, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer’s,</A><br>
<A>which is politic, nor the lady’s, which is nice, nor</A><br>
<A>the lover’s, which is all these: but it is a</A><br>
<A>melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,</A><br>
<A>extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry’s</A><br>
<A>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</A><br>
<A>rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to</A><br>
<A>be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see</A><br>
<A>other men’s; then, to have seen much and to have</A><br>
<A>nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Jaques</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Yes, I have gained my experience.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have</A><br>
<A>a fool to make me merry than experience to make me</A><br>
<A>sad; and to travel for it too!</A><br>
<p><i>Enter ORLANDO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Jaques</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Nay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and</A><br>
<A>wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your</A><br>
<A>own country, be out of love with your nativity and</A><br>
<A>almost chide God for making you that countenance you</A><br>
<A>are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a</A><br>
<A>gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been</A><br>
<A>all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such</A><br>
<A>another trick, never come in my sight more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Break an hour’s promise in love! He that will</A><br>
<A>divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but</A><br>
<A>a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the</A><br>
<A>affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid</A><br>
<A>hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but I’ll warrant</A><br>
<A>him heart-whole.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I</A><br>
<A>had as lief be wooed of a snail.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Of a snail?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he</A><br>
<A>carries his house on his head; a better jointure,</A><br>
<A>I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings</A><br>
<A>his destiny with him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>What’s that?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be</A><br>
<A>beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in</A><br>
<A>his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>And I am your Rosalind.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Celia</td>
<blockquote>
<A>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a</A><br>
<A>Rosalind of a better leer than you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday</A><br>
<A>humour and like enough to consent. What would you</A><br>
<A>say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I would kiss before I spoke.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were</A><br>
<A>gravelled for lack of matter, you might take</A><br>
<A>occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are</A><br>
<A>out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking⁠—God</A><br>
<A>warn us!⁠—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>How if the kiss be denied?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or</A><br>
<A>I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>What, of my suit?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</A><br>
<A>Am not I your Rosalind?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be</A><br>
<A>talking of her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Well in her person I say I will not have you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Then in mine own person I die.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</A><br>
<A>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</A><br>
<A>there was not any man died in his own person,</A><br>
<A>videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</A><br>
<A>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</A><br>
<A>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</A><br>
<A>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</A><br>
<A>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</A><br>
<A>for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</A><br>
<A>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</A><br>
<A>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</A><br>
<A>coroners of that age found it was ‘Hero of Sestos.’</A><br>
<A>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</A><br>
<A>time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</A><br>
<A>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</A><br>
<A>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</A><br>
<A>disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</A><br>
<A>it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Then love me, Rosalind.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>And wilt thou have me?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Ay, and twenty such.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>What sayest thou?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>

<A>Are you not good?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>

<A>I hope so.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</A><br>
<A>Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</A><br>
<A>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Pray thee, marry us.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Celia</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I cannot say the words.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>You must begin, ‘Will you, Orlando⁠—’</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Celia</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I will.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Ay, but when?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Then you must say ‘I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.’</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</A><br>
<A>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there’s a girl goes</A><br>
<A>before the priest; and certainly a woman’s thought</A><br>
<A>runs before her actions.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>

<A>So do all thoughts; they are winged.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</A><br>
<A>have possessed her.</A><br>

<A>For ever and a day.</A><br>

<A>Say ‘a day,’ without the ‘ever.’ No, no, Orlando;</A><br>
<A>men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</A><br>
<A>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</A><br>
<A>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</A><br>
<A>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</A><br>
<A>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</A><br>
<A>new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</A><br>
<A>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</A><br>
<A>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</A><br>
<A>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</A><br>
<A>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A>But will my Rosalind do so?</A><br>

<A>O, but she is wise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the</A><br>
<A>wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman’s</A><br>
<A>wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and</A><br>
<A>’twill out at the key-hole; stop that, ’twill fly</A><br>
<A>with the smoke out at the chimney.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Orlando</td>
<blockquote>
<A>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say</A><br>
<A>‘Wit, whither wilt?’</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met</A><br>
<A>your wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<tr><td epub:type="z3998:persona">Rosalind</td>
<blockquote>
<A>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall</A><br>
<A>never take her without her answer, unless you take</A><br>
<A>her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot</A><br>
<A>make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her</A><br>
<A>never nurse her child herself, for she will breed</A><br>

<A>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you</A><br>

<A>if you break one jot of your promise or come one</A><br>
<A>minute behind your hour, I will think you the most</A><br>
<A>pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover</A><br>
<A>and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that</A><br>
<A>may be chosen out of the gross band of the</A><br>

<A>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</A><br>
<A>no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no</A><br>
<A>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</A><br>
<A>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</A><br>
<A>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</A><br>
<A>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</A><br>
<A>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</A><br>
<A>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</A><br>
<A>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I’ll begin</A><br>
<A>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</A><br>
<A>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</A><br>
<A>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</A><br>
<A>you bear to women⁠—as I perceive by your simpering,</A><br>
<A>none of you hates them⁠—that between you and the</A><br>
<A>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</A><br>
<A>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</A><br>
<A>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</A><br>
<A>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</A><br>
<A>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</A><br>
<A>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</A><br>
