<A>EPILOGUE</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</A><br>
<A>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</A><br>
<A>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</A><br>
<A>no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no</A><br>
<A>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</A><br>
<A>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</A><br>
<A>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</A><br>
<A>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</A><br>
<A>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</A><br>
<A>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</A><br>
<A>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I’ll begin</A><br>
<A>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</A><br>
<A>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</A><br>
<A>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</A><br>
<A>you bear to women⁠—as I perceive by your simpering,</A><br>
<A>none of you hates them⁠—that between you and the</A><br>
<A>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</A><br>
<A>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</A><br>
<A>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</A><br>
<A>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</A><br>
<A>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</A><br>
<A>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</A><br>
